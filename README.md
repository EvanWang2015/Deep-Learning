# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repository contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## What I want to share with you

**VERBOSE CONTENT WARNING: YOU CAN JUMP TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU WANT**

I have recently finished my Phd in Nuclear Engineering and a concurrent MS in Computer Engineering. I have strong interest in Data Analytics and coding. 
I am very grateful there are many free/cheap resources available online that help me to teach myself and learn from others. I have completed many CS and Math related MooCs on Coursera and MIT online courses, and deeply understand learning by yourself could be challenging sometimes. 
I hope this work will be somehow useful to you.  

Note: the last course of Deep Learning, Sequence Modelling is not available yet. I will update it as soon as possible.
