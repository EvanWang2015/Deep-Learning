## What I want to share with you

**VERBOSE CONTENT WARNING: YOU CAN JUMP TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU WANT**

I have recently finished my Phd in Nuclear Engineering and a concurrent MS in Computer Engineering. I have strong interest in Data Analytics and coding. There are many overlappings between my research and machine learning techniques. 
I am very grateful there are many free/cheap resources available online that help you to teach yourself and learn from others. I have completed many CS and Math related MooCs on Coursera and Udemy, and deeply understand learning by yourself could be challenging sometimes. 
I hope my work will be useful to you.  

Note: the last course of Deep Learning, Sequence Modelling is not available yet. I will update it as soon as possible.
